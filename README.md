# Mumbai Data Exploration & Visualization

Welcome to the Mumbai Data Exploration & Visualization repository! This project leverages the powerful OSMnx library to extract and visualize a wide array of data, starting with the intricate network of roads in Mumbai. Designed to be flexible and adaptable, this tool can be customized to gather and plot different types of urban data, offering insights into the city's layout, infrastructure, and more.

## Project Overview

### Data Extraction & Visualization (`play.py`)
At the heart of this project is the `play.py` script, a versatile tool for data scientists, urban planners, and curious explorers alike. While our current focus is on mapping Mumbai's roads, the script's true power lies in its adaptability. Users can extract a variety of data points - from green spaces and water bodies to urban landmarks and transportation networks - and visualize them on detailed maps. This feature makes it an invaluable resource for comprehensive urban analysis and planning.
